## About
I made this layout as a realistic replacement for the qwerty keyboard layout. It is focuses on these points:
* Must be optimal for spanish writting (Sorry english typing users).
* It must be more ergonomical to coding users (ex. parentheses and curl brackets on the uppermost index finger side, shift press is needed to send numbers input).
* Conserve 'z', 'x', 'c' and 'v' keys on same position.
* Conserve 'f' and j keys on same position.
* Conserve 'q' key on same position.

## Installation
1. Install autohotkey on your computer, [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/) you will find the installer.
2. Run the 'AutoHotkey_1.1.34.03_setup' file, then close the window.
3. Run the 'Antitesis Layout.ahk' file from this repo.

## End session
Exit the 'Antitesis Layout' script from taskbar.
## Version
v1.4
